# YouTube Video Downloader

Download YouTube videos with full control over quality and format settings.

## Quick Start

The simplest way to download a video:

```bash
python scripts/download_video.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

This downloads the video in best available quality as MP4 to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`.

## Options

### Quality Settings

Use `-q` or `--quality` to specify video quality:

- `best` (default): Highest quality available
- `1080p`: Full HD
- `720p`: HD
- `480p`: Standard definition
- `360p`: Lower quality
- `worst`: Lowest quality available

Example:
```bash
python scripts/download_video.py "URL" -q 720p
```

### Format Options

Use `-f` or `--format` to specify output format (video downloads only):

- `mp4` (default): Most compatible
- `webm`: Modern format
- `mkv`: Matroska container

Example:
```bash
python scripts/download_video.py "URL" -f webm
```

### Audio Only

Use `-a` or `--audio-only` to download only audio as MP3:

```bash
python scripts/download_video.py "URL" -a
```

### Custom Output Directory

Use `-o` or `--output` to specify a different output directory:

```bash
python scripts/download_video.py "URL" -o /path/to/directory
```

## Complete Examples

1. Download video in 1080p as MP4:
```bash
python scripts/download_video.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" -q 1080p
```

2. Download audio only as MP3:
```bash
python scripts/download_video.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" -a
```

3. Download in 720p as WebM to custom directory:
```bash
python scripts/download_video.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" -q 720p -f webm -o /custom/path
```

## Supported URLs

- **HTTPS only** — `http://` links are rejected.
- **YouTube hosts only** — allowed hostnames include `youtube.com` (and subdomains such as `www`, `m`, `music`), `youtu.be`, and `youtube-nocookie.com` (including `www`). Other sites are rejected.

## yt-dlp installation

The script does **not** install packages into your system Python (no `--break-system-packages`).

1. If `yt-dlp` is on your `PATH`, it is used.
2. Otherwise it creates a **local virtualenv** at `video-downloader/.venv`, installs `yt-dlp` there with `pip`, and runs that binary.
3. If venv creation or install fails, follow the printed message or install globally, for example: `pipx install yt-dlp`, `brew install yt-dlp`, or your OS package manager.

The `.venv` directory is gitignored and stays inside the skill folder.

## How It Works

The skill uses `yt-dlp`, a robust YouTube downloader that:
- Resolves `yt-dlp` via PATH or the skill-local `.venv` as described above
- Fetches video information before downloading
- Selects the best available streams matching your criteria
- Merges video and audio streams when needed
- Supports a wide range of YouTube video formats

## Important Notes

- Downloads are saved to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` by default
- Video filename is automatically generated from the video title
- Only single videos are downloaded (playlists are skipped by default)
- Higher quality videos may take longer to download and use more disk space
